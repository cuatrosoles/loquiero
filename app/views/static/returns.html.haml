  %h3 Submitting a Product Return Request
  %p Users have 14 days after delivery to return an item won or purchased through Buy Now unless otherwise noted. Items returned must be in good condition and you are responsible for shipping costs. Return and cancellation requests can be submitted through our #{link_to "Contact Form", contact_path}.
  %p If, for any reason, you are unable to return the item in good, working condition, FirstBargain.com will retain the right to accept the returned item and reduce the amount of your refund in a proportion equal to the damage on the item (as determined by FirstBargain.com in its sole discretion). In no case will the return of an item entitle you to a refund of the Bid Credits used to win or purchase the item.
