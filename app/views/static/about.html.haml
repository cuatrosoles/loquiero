      %h3 Innovative Live Auctions
      %p  Our auctions work quite differently from eBayâ€™s. All items start at $0 and each bid raises the price by only a few pennies. When the remaining time on the auction clock is under 30 seconds (or 20 seconds depending on the auction), each bid adds several seconds back onto the timer. The last bidder standing when the timer runs out wins the auction. Bids costs only $0.75 each, and winners walk away with huge bargains!
